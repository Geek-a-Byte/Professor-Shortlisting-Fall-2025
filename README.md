# Professor-Shortlisting-Fall-2025

My Research Interests are as follows:
- MLSys (Intersection of ML and Software/Cloud based systems/ Latency optimization of ML inference/ AI in healthcare etc)
- Trustworthy ML/Privacy in ML/Federated learning
- Software Engineering + HCI + ML
- Distributed Systems (Microservices)
